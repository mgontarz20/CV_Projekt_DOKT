# CV_Projekt_DOKT

Our Computer Vision Project:

"Convolutional Neural Network for Background Removing from Optical Fringe Pattern Images"

Project is based on the following literature:

The project has been split into 4 parts: 


Introduction, theory and goals (M. Rogalski)

Neural network training dataset preparation (O. Sobiecki)

Network architecture definition, training, and result preparation (M. Gontarz - owner of this repository)

Network evaluation, further testing and possible phase retrieval (B. Mirecki)


To run the pipeline download the model by contacting the repo owner, place an image into 'execute' directory and run the pipeline_execution.py script.

Model included separately due to size issues.
